# Huegasm

Music awesomeness for hue lights.

It lives at http://www.huegasm.com

## Current priorities
- create a hybrid app with Cardova

## WTF
Cordova disables the volume buttons for some reason. Monkey patching that shit ( must be a better way :( ).
Comment out: webView.setButtonPlumbedToJs lines from its source code.

## POSSIBLE FUTURE FEATURES
- decode the hue color better
- better visualizations
- beat settings by interval
- auto beat detection mode
- display player time when hovering over seek bar
